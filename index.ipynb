    "\n",
    "Use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to download the files (or download the [zip file](https://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises/archive/master.zip)), use the Python package management system [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) to install a few Python libraries that we will use and then start the IPython notebook:\n",

    "    git clone https://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises.git\n",
    "    cd communication-acoustics-exercises\n",

    "If you are new to Git, have a look at this [introduction to Git](http://mg.rtfd.org/git.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also download individual notebook files (with the extension `.ipynb`) and open them in IPython.\n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure you always use Python 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have *only* Python 3 installed on your system, the aforementioned commands might be called `pip` and `ipython`, respectively.\n",
    "At some point, the command for starting the notebook will change to `jupyter` or `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter-notebook` or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Python 3 installed already, you should download and install a Python distribution which already includes all the libraries we'll need, e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (make sure to choose Python version 3.x).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/...), you should install the following packages: python3, python3-pip, python3-numpy, python3-scipy, python3-matplotlib, python3-cffi, libsndfile1, libportaudio2.\n",
