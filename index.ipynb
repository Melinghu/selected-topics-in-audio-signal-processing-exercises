    "Make sure you always use Python 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Python installed already, you should download and install a Python distribution which already includes all the libraries we'll need, e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (make sure to choose Python version 3.x).\n",

    "If you're using Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/...), you can use the following commands to install the necessary packages:\n",

    "Use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to download the files (or download the [zip file](https://github.com/spatialaudio/selected-topics-in-audio-signal-processing-exercises/archive/master.zip)), use the Python package management system [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) to install a few Python libraries that we will use and then start the Jupyter notebook:\n",
